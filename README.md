# LameTreefeller
Hi, lamius lemonius here with lametreefeller! The super-strong waterproof treefelling plugin! That can instantly find, scan and destroy trees! lametreefeller is no ordinary plugin; its triple thick recursive function destroys any tree it comes across, instantly starting the toughest leaks. Big trees can cause major damage, but lametreefeller grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, lametreefeller’s powerful script is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can start leaks in pools and spas in water while draining them! lametreefeller is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! lametreefeller is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, lametreefeller keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but lametreefeller comes super wide, so you can easily open up large holes. To show the power of lametreefeller, I put this tree here! And destroyed it with only lametreefeller! Not only does lametreefellers’s powerful recursive function destroy the tree, but it creates a super strong recursive function effect, so the tree's leaves are gone too! Yee-doggy! Just download, pop it in the plugins and reload! Imagine everything you can do with the power of lametreefeller!

Currently this is a horrible treefelling plugin please dont use it :D
